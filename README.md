## Real-Time Embedded Systems

This repo contains notes and programming assignments for the Coursera's "[Real-Time Embedded Systems](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/real-time-embedded-systems)" Specialization by University of Colorado Boulder.

Date: June, 2022.

- The course is instructed by Professor Sam Siewert.

- You can find the **[syllabus](Syllabus.md)** of this course.
 

## Descriptions

The Specialization is a series of four courses and covers topics including: concurrency, Linux kernel modules, machine vision, co-processors, and correct function with timing constraints. Specific real-time extensions to Linux are used to compare advantages and disadvantages of Linux to more traditional RTOS, cyclic executive, and FPGA options. Experience gained can be used to launch additional exploration of hybrid FPGA systems (e.g. Altera and Xilinx) and multi-core scale-up (e.g. ARM A and R-Series) as well as MCU scale-down solutions (ARM M-Series microprocessors).

## Requirements

**[CanaKit Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-starter-max-kit.html)** - Meets courses requirements for Shared Memory, Multi-core, Vector instructions, Pthreads, Raspbian. \
**[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)** - Any code editor but sublime is a better choice for Ubuntu and Windows. \
**[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** - My recommendation due to the integration of GitHub in the same coding IDE.
